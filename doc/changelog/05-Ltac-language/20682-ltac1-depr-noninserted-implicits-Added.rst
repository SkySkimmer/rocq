- **Added:**
  flag :flag:`Ltac Always Insert Implicits` to interprete a :n:`@qualid` argument to a ltac as a term (with insertion of any implicit arguments, unfolding notations, etc)
  in a toplevel :cmd:`Ltac` definition instead of interpreting it as the reference without implicit arguments.
  Note that tactics in proof scripts already interpret :n:`@qualid` arguments as terms, so enabling the flag unifies the two behaviours
