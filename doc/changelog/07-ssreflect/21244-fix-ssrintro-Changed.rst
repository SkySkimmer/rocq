- **Changed:**
  level of ``tactic => intro_pattern`` notation to a left-associative
  notation level with higher priority than level 3, rather than being
  repeated in levels 3 (right-associative) and 4 (left-associative)
  (`#21244 <https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/pull/21244>`_,
  by Pierre Roux).
